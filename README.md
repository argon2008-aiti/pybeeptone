pybeeptone
==========

Creates fixed-frequency tones on the speaker reminiscent of the QBasic SOUND command and PC-speaker music. Requires pyaudio.

There should be a simpler way to do this. Unfortunately, the Python winsound library only works on Windows and the pyaudiere library seems to be abandoned. Many thanks to taneli of AskUbuntu.com for writing up an example showing how to feed a fixed frequency tone to pyaudio.
